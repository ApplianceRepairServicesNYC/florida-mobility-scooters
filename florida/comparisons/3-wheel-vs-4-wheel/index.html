                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The choice between three-wheel and four-wheel mobility scooters represents one of the most fundamental decisions when selecting a scooter. Each configuration offers distinct advantages and trade-offs that affect maneuverability, stability, indoor suitability, outdoor capability, and user confidence.</p>
                <p>Neither configuration is universally "better"—the right choice depends on your primary use environment, physical needs, and personal preferences. Understanding these differences helps match the scooter to your situation.</p>

                <h2>Three-Wheel Scooter Characteristics</h2>
                
                <h3>Maneuverability Advantage</h3>
                <p>Three-wheel scooters excel in tight spaces due to their tighter turning radius. The single front wheel pivots more sharply than dual front wheels, allowing turns in confined areas. This makes three-wheel scooters ideal for navigating crowded stores, narrow hallways, and indoor environments where space is limited.</p>
                
                <h3>Open Front Design</h3>
                <p>The single front wheel creates an open area for feet and legs. Users can position their feet more freely and often find mounting and dismounting easier. This design particularly benefits users with mobility limitations who need unobstructed foot positioning.</p>
                
                <h3>Stability Considerations</h3>
                <p>Three-wheel scooters have three contact points with the ground versus four, creating a triangular base. While modern three-wheel scooters are stable for normal use, they may feel less secure during aggressive turns or on uneven surfaces. Users with balance concerns may prefer the additional stability of four wheels.</p>
                
                <h3>Indoor Optimization</h3>
                <p>Three-wheel configurations particularly suit indoor use in shopping centers, medical facilities, and home environments. Their ability to navigate tight corners, narrow aisles, and doorways makes them practical for these applications.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Four-Wheel Scooter Characteristics</h2>
                
                <h3>Superior Stability</h3>
                <p>Four-wheel scooters provide a wider base with four contact points, creating greater stability. They resist tipping during turns, handle uneven surfaces better, and generally inspire more confidence, especially for users concerned about balance.</p>
                
                <h3>Outdoor Capability</h3>
                <p>The stability advantage translates to better outdoor performance. Four-wheel scooters handle grass, gravel paths, uneven pavement, and other outdoor terrain more confidently than three-wheel counterparts. For users who plan significant outdoor use, four wheels typically perform better.</p>
                
                <h3>Higher Weight Capacity Options</h3>
                <p>Heavy-duty and bariatric scooters almost universally use four-wheel designs. The wider stance and additional structural support better accommodate higher weight capacities. Users needing capacities above 350 pounds generally choose four-wheel models.</p>
                
                <h3>Wider Turning Requirements</h3>
                <p>Four-wheel scooters need more space to turn around. In tight hallways or small rooms, completing turns may require multi-point maneuvering. Users should consider their primary environments when evaluating whether wider turning radius presents practical challenges.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Florida-Specific Considerations</h2>
                
                <h3>Indoor Use Dominates Many Situations</h3>
                <p>Florida's air-conditioned culture means many mobility scooter users spend significant time in shopping centers, malls, and indoor venues. For primarily indoor use, three-wheel scooters' maneuverability advantages may outweigh stability trade-offs.</p>
                
                <h3>Flat Terrain Benefits Both</h3>
                <p>Florida's predominantly flat terrain reduces some stability concerns that affect hilly regions. Without steep inclines, three-wheel scooters perform more confidently outdoors than they might elsewhere. However, four-wheel stability still helps on uneven surfaces like sandy areas or older sidewalks.</p>
                
                <h3>Retirement Community Considerations</h3>
                <p>Florida retirement communities often feature wide sidewalks and golf cart paths. Four-wheel scooters navigate these environments easily while providing outdoor stability. However, some indoor community spaces have tight corners where three-wheel maneuverability helps.</p>
                
                <h3>Theme Park Navigation</h3>
                <p>Florida's theme parks involve both indoor queuing and outdoor walking. Three-wheel scooters handle tight queue areas better, while four-wheel scooters handle diverse outdoor terrain. Neither is definitively better for theme parks—the choice depends on individual priorities.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Choosing Based on Use Case</h2>
                
                <h3>Primarily Indoor Use</h3>
                <p>If most scooter use involves shopping, indoor activities, and navigating buildings, three-wheel scooters often provide practical advantages. Their maneuverability in crowded, confined spaces improves daily convenience.</p>
                
                <h3>Primarily Outdoor Use</h3>
                <p>Users who plan significant outdoor activities—parks, trails, neighborhood sidewalks—generally find four-wheel scooters more suitable. Better stability on varied terrain and greater confidence during extended outdoor use matter more than tight turning radius.</p>
                
                <h3>Mixed Use</h3>
                <p>Many users need scooters for both indoor and outdoor activities. Consider which environment dominates or which is more challenging. Four-wheel scooters work adequately indoors with some inconvenience in tight spaces. Three-wheel scooters work outdoors on smooth surfaces but may limit terrain options.</p>
                
                <h3>Balance or Stability Concerns</h3>
                <p>Users with balance issues, stability concerns, or anxiety about tipping generally prefer four-wheel scooters regardless of primary environment. The psychological comfort of greater stability improves overall experience and encourages scooter use.</p>
