                <h1>About Florida Mobility Guide</h1>
                
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Florida Mobility Guide exists to provide clear, helpful, and unbiased information about mobility scooters specifically for Florida residents and visitors. We understand that choosing a mobility scooter involves many factors, and Florida's unique climate, terrain, and lifestyle create considerations that don't apply everywhere.</p>
                <p>Our goal is to help readers understand these factors so they can make informed decisions appropriate to their individual needs and circumstances.</p>
                
                <h2>What We Provide</h2>
                <p>This website offers educational content covering various aspects of mobility scooter selection and use in Florida, including general information about mobility scooter types and features, Florida-specific considerations related to climate, terrain, and lifestyle, use-case guides for different mobility needs, county-specific information for major Florida counties, and comparison guides explaining different scooter configurations.</p>
                
                <h2>What We Are Not</h2>
                <p>We want to be transparent about what this website is and isn't. Florida Mobility Guide is an informational website, not a retailer or seller of mobility scooters, a medical provider or healthcare service, a local business operating in Florida, or a lead generation service. We don't sell products, provide medical advice, or offer local services.</p>
                
                <h2>How We Operate</h2>
                <p>Florida Mobility Guide generates revenue through affiliate partnerships. When readers choose to explore products through links on this site and make purchases, we may receive commissions from retailers. This arrangement is fully disclosed on our <a href="/disclosure/">Affiliate Disclosure</a> page.</p>
                <p>These affiliate relationships do not influence our editorial content. We provide the same information regardless of whether readers use our affiliate links, and we do not recommend products based on commission potential.</p>
                
                <h2>Editorial Standards</h2>
                <p>Our content aims to be accurate, balanced, and genuinely helpful. We strive to present information neutrally without pushing readers toward specific products, acknowledge the limitations of different scooter types honestly, update content to maintain accuracy, and clearly distinguish educational content from affiliate links.</p>
                
                <h2>Florida Focus</h2>
                <p>Unlike general mobility scooter resources, this site focuses specifically on Florida. We discuss how Florida's subtropical climate affects scooter selection and use, address terrain considerations from beaches to theme parks, acknowledge the state's significant senior population and related infrastructure, and cover travel considerations relevant to Florida's airports and cruise ports. This focused approach aims to provide more relevant information for Florida-based readers than generic national resources.</p>
                
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>We acknowledge several limitations with our content. First, this site provides general information, not medical advice. Individual mobility needs should be discussed with healthcare providers. Second, product information changes over time, and we may not always have the most current specifications. Third, we cannot evaluate every product personally, so our comparisons focus on general categories and features rather than specific product recommendations. Fourth, everyone's needs are different, and what works for one person may not suit another.</p>
                
                <h2>Contact</h2>
                <p>For questions, feedback, or concerns about content on this website, please reach out through the methods available on the site. We appreciate input that helps us improve the usefulness and accuracy of our information.</p>
