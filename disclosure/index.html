                <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
                
                <p><strong>Last Updated: January 2025</strong></p>
                
                <h2>FTC Disclosure Statement</h2>
                <p>In compliance with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines, this disclosure explains how Florida Mobility Guide generates revenue and maintains transparency with readers.</p>
                
                <h2>Affiliate Relationships</h2>
                <p>Florida Mobility Guide participates in affiliate marketing programs. This means that when you click on certain links on this website and make a purchase from a third-party retailer, we may receive a commission at no additional cost to you.</p>
                <p>These affiliate relationships do not influence our editorial content. The information, comparisons, and educational material on this site are provided to help readers make informed decisions, not to promote specific products for commission purposes.</p>
                
                <h2>How Affiliate Links Work</h2>
                <p>Affiliate links on this site are presented within expandable sections clearly marked as product information areas. We do not disguise affiliate links as editorial content or embed them deceptively within informational text.</p>
                <p>When you choose to view product specifications through these sections, you may be directed to third-party retailers. If you make a purchase through these links, we may earn a commission. This commission comes from the retailer, not from you—you pay the same price regardless of whether you use our affiliate link.</p>
                
                <h2>What This Site Is</h2>
                <p>Florida Mobility Guide is an informational and editorial website focused on providing educational content about mobility scooters specifically for Florida residents and visitors. We are:</p>
                <p>• An informational resource providing educational content<br>
                • An affiliate publisher earning commissions from referrals<br>
                • A guide helping readers understand mobility scooter options</p>
                
                <h2>What This Site Is Not</h2>
                <p>To be clear about our role, Florida Mobility Guide is NOT:</p>
                <p>• A retailer or seller of mobility scooters<br>
                • A medical provider or healthcare service<br>
                • A dealer, installer, or service provider<br>
                • A lead generation service collecting personal information for third parties<br>
                • A local business operating in any specific Florida location</p>
                
                <h2>Editorial Independence</h2>
                <p>Our editorial content is created to provide genuinely useful information. We do not receive payment for favorable coverage of specific products or brands. The comparisons, use-case guides, and educational content on this site reflect our honest assessment of factors relevant to mobility scooter selection.</p>
                
                <h2>No Medical Advice</h2>
                <p>Information on this website is for general educational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice. Mobility needs vary by individual, and decisions about mobility equipment should involve consultation with healthcare providers familiar with your specific situation.</p>
                
                <h2>Third-Party Responsibility</h2>
                <p>When you visit third-party retailer websites through links on this site, you are subject to those sites' terms, conditions, and privacy policies. Florida Mobility Guide is not responsible for the products, services, pricing, policies, or practices of third-party retailers.</p>
